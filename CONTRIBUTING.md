# Contributing

## Setup

- Node.js `^22.18.0 || >=24.11.0` to build (the published plugin itself supports `>=22.12`)
- npm. pnpm is only used to publish, as a pinned devDependency; don't install with it.

```sh
npm ci
```

In VS Code, install the [Oxc extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oxc.oxc-vscode).
The shared `.vscode/settings.json` makes it the formatter and turns off Prettier, ESLint and
Import Sorter for this workspace.

## Local development

Link the plugin into a local Studio with [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

1. In the Studio, install its dependencies, so the plugin's own dependencies are installed there:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. In the plugin, build on every change and push each build to linked Studios:

   ```sh
   npm run link-watch
   ```

3. In the Studio, link the plugin:

   ```sh
   npx yalc link @electrolux-oss/sanity-plugin-media
   ls -l node_modules/@electrolux-oss/   # sanity-plugin-media -> …/.yalc/@electrolux-oss/sanity-plugin-media
   git diff package.json                 # no change
   ```

4. Start the Studio. Reload it to pick up changes, and restart its dev server if it keeps serving
   an old build.

While linked, don't run `npm install` in the Studio: it replaces the link with the published
version. Run `npx yalc link @electrolux-oss/sanity-plugin-media` again if you did. To stop:

```sh
npx yalc remove @electrolux-oss/sanity-plugin-media && npm install
```

Don't use `yalc add`. It writes `file:.yalc/…` into the Studio's `package.json`, and with
`link-watch` every rebuild replaces the plugin with a copy that can't resolve its own
dependencies.

## Checks

Run these before opening a pull request:

```sh
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # oxlint: type-aware, warnings count as errors
npx oxfmt --check   # formatting
npm run build       # plugin-kit verify-package, then pkg-utils
```

`npm run build` doesn't type-check (pkg-utils generates types without checking them), so run
`typecheck` or `lint` to catch type errors. `npm run format` formats everything, and
`npm run lint:fix` applies oxlint's safe fixes.

## Code style

- Formatting is [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter.html) with plugin-kit's preset
  and the repository's previous Prettier settings on top (`oxfmt.config.ts`). It also sorts
  imports and `package.json`.
- Linting is [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) with plugin-kit's shared config
  (`oxlint.config.ts`). A disable comment needs a reason:
  `// oxlint-disable-next-line <rule> -- <why>`.
- There are three TypeScript configs: `tsconfig.json` for the editor and type checks (includes
  tests and `package.config.ts`), `tsconfig.dist.json` for the build (excludes tests), and
  `tsconfig.settings.json` with the options both share.

### Icons

`@sanity/icons` is a devDependency, so pkg-utils bundles the icons into `dist`, and the plugin
doesn't depend on which copy a Studio hoists. Import icons from their subpaths only
(`import { AddIcon } from '@sanity/icons/Add'`). The root entry's icon map pulls in every icon as a
separate chunk. After a build, this must print `0`:

```sh
grep -c "@sanity/icons" dist/index.js
```

## Branches

Branch from an up-to-date `main` and name the branch `<type>/<short-description>`, using the same
types as commits:

```sh
git fetch origin
git switch --no-track -c fix/filter-bar-scrollbar origin/main
git push -u origin fix/filter-bar-scrollbar:fix/filter-bar-scrollbar
```

`--no-track` and the explicit `branch:branch` push stop a plain `git push` from going to `main`.

## Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`.

| Type       | For                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | a new feature for people using the plugin                |
| `fix`      | a bug fix for people using the plugin                    |
| `refactor` | a code change that is neither a feature nor a fix        |
| `docs`     | documentation only                                       |
| `style`    | formatting only, no code change                          |
| `test`     | tests only                                               |
| `build`    | dependencies, build tooling, packaging and version bumps |
| `chore`    | anything else that doesn't touch the plugin or its build |

- Write the summary in lower case and the imperative: `fix: remove the vertical scrollbar from the filter bar`.
- `build(deps)` is for dependency updates. A scope is otherwise optional.
- Mark a breaking change with `!` (`feat!: …`) and explain it in the body.
- Write the body as `- ` bullets, one per change, after a blank line.
- Keep formatting-only changes in their own `style` commit, and add a large reformat's hash to
  `.git-blame-ignore-revs`.

## Pull requests

- One topic per pull request. Its title follows the commit format, and for a single commit it's
  the commit's subject.
- Describe it with these sections, leaving out any that don't apply:

  ```markdown
  ## Summary

  ## Why

  ## Changes

  ## Testing
  ```

- Merge with **Create a merge commit**. Squash and rebase merges change commit hashes, which
  breaks `.git-blame-ignore-revs` and loses the individual commits.

## Versioning

The plugin follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). These are **major** changes:

- dropping support for a Studio version, or raising a peer dependency's minimum
- changing the module format or removing an export
- changing a default behaviour (keep the old default and make the new behaviour opt-in to avoid a
  major)

A change that doesn't affect the published package, such as editor settings or documentation
outside the README, doesn't need a release. The npm package contains only `dist`, the README, the
license and `package.json`.

## Releasing

Releases are made by maintainers with the organisation's npm credentials.

1. **Bump the version in its own pull request.** Branch `build/bump-X.Y.Z`, with one commit and
   the pull request title `build: bump version to X.Y.Z`:

   ```sh
   npm version X.Y.Z --no-git-tag-version
   ```

2. **Publish behind `next`** from an up-to-date, clean `main`:

   ```sh
   git switch main && git pull --ff-only origin main && npm ci
   npm run publish:next:dry-run
   npm run publish:next
   ```

   Always publish with these scripts. They run `pnpm publish --tag next`: pnpm applies
   `publishConfig.exports`, and npm doesn't, so a plain `npm publish` would ship a `source` export
   pointing at the unshipped `src/` and move `latest` straight away.

3. **Check the release in a Studio** installed from `next`:

   ```sh
   npm i @electrolux-oss/sanity-plugin-media@next
   ```

4. **Move `latest`:**

   ```sh
   npm dist-tag add @electrolux-oss/sanity-plugin-media@X.Y.Z latest
   ```

5. **Tag the merge commit** on `main` with an annotated tag:

   ```sh
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

6. **Publish the GitHub release** from that tag, marked as latest, titled `vX.Y.Z: <summary>`
   (for example `v5.0.1: Filter bar scrollbar fix`). Use "Generate release notes" for the list of
   pull requests and write the rest above it:

   ```markdown
   <What changed for people using the plugin, whether anything breaks, and the supported Studio versions.>

   Leave out any section that's empty. A breaking change also gets an entry in the README's
   "Breaking changes" section.
